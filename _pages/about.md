## Mission Statement  
The lymphatic system, composed of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, is a crucial component of nearly every organ in the body. It plays a central role in maintaining health and is intricately involved in various inflammatory diseases and chronic conditions, including cancer. Despite its significance, the complexities of lymphatic function and disease remain underexplored.  

Our lab is dedicated to advancing the understanding of lymphatic biology and pathology through innovative, multidisciplinary approaches. These include:  
--Lymphatic and Lymph Node Biomechanics    
-- Lymphatic Tissue Engineering  
-- Advanced Imaging Techniques  

  

<p>Through these efforts, we aim to bridge fundamental research with clinical applications, driving advancements in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lymphatic diseases. Our ultimate mission is to translate these discoveries into impactful solutions to improve human health and well-being. </p>
