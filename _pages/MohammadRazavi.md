Biography:
Dr. Mohammad Razavi, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL). He specializes in studying the lymphatic system and developing bioengineered models to advance the understanding of lymphatic diseases. His research lies at the intersection of biomechanics and biology, utilizing computational modeling, in vivo, and in vitro studies to uncover new insights into the lymphatic system. Dr. Razavi’s research program aims to advance the understanding of the lymphatic system through an interdisciplinary approach, combining engineering principles with biological science to address critical challenges in health and medicine.

Before joining UNL, Dr. Razavi completed a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. He earned his Ph.D. in Bioengineering and Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. Razavi’s achievements have been  recognized with several awards. He is a recipient of the American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship and the NIH National Research Service Award (F32) postdoctoral felloehsip,  the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (declined), LE&RN Young Investigator Travel Award, as a finalist for the ASME-SB3C Best Dissertation. Earlier in his academic journey, he was honored with the Best MS Research Award and the prestigious Honored Student Award from Isfahan University of Technology (IUT).
