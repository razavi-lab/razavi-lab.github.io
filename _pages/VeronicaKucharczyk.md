My name is Veronica Kucharczyk and I am from Huntley, Illinois. I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I studied Bioengineering with a concentration in Imaging and Sensing along with minors in Chemistry and Electrical Engineering. I am excited to be working towards my Ph.D. at UNL where I will focus on imaging of the lymphatic system. In my free time I like to go to Pilates or read!
